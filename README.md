## Hi! KumaTea here ðŸ‘‹

I major in Clinical Medicine while having a strong interest in Computer Science.

I use Python for most of my projects.

I seldom check my email but stay 24/7 on [Telegram @KumaTea](https://t.me/KumaTea).

## Projects

### Active

I enjoy exploring new and emerging things before they popularize.
